## Welcome to my Business Analysis and Data Analysis portfolio.

Here, I present projects developed using my skills in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Business Intelligence.

All the code was developed on Google Colab.

# 1. Sales Optimization through Predictive Analytics
Description :
This project aims to predict car purchase amounts based on demographic and financial data (Car Sales dataset from Kaggle).

Techniques Used :
Data cleaning, feature encoding, building a Linear Regression model with scikit-learn, evaluation using RMSE.

Tools :
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).

Conclusion :
By applying machine learning algorithms, I was able to accurately predict car purchase amounts. This project demonstrates my ability to handle a full data science workflow, from data cleaning to predictive modeling.

# 2. Business Intelligence KPI Dashboard for Management
Description :
Creation of a KPI dashboard to analyze the performance of top restaurant chains in the United States (Restaurant Business Rankings 2020 dataset from Kaggle).

Techniques Used :
Data cleaning, KPI creation (annual sales, ranking, number of locations), visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Tools :
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

Conclusion :
I designed a clear and insightful dashboard to visualize restaurant performance. This project highlights my ability to turn raw business data into actionable insights for management.
